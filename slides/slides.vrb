\frametitle{Finding the right button}
\begin{itemize}
^^I\item The page buttons are saved as children of the \verb!<div class='ui pagination menu'>! tag.
^^I\item Their tags are of the form \verb!<a class="item">!.
^^I\item Unfortunately, the ``Next'' button does not have a unique id/name.
^^I\item However, using \verb!find_all()!, we can find the list of \verb!<a class="item">! items, look at the last one, and determine if it is a ``Next'' button or not
\end{itemize}
