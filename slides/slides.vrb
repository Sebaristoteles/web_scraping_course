\frametitle{Finding the right button}
\begin{itemize}
^^I\item The page buttons are saved as children of the \mintinline{html}{<div class='ui pagination menu'>} tag.
^^I\item Their tags are of the form \mintinline{html}{<a class="item">}.
^^I\item Unfortunately, the ``Next'' button does not have a unique id/name.
^^I\item However, using \mintinline{python}{.find_all()}, we can find the list of \mintinline{python}{<a class="item">} items, look at the last one, and determine if it is a ``Next'' button or not
\end{itemize}
